Store the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) in this directory. The CRL file
must be in PEM format.

It is the user's responsibility to keep CRLs up to date. The files are
loaded at Splunk startup and are automatically updated at restart. To
update CRL info while Splunk is running, run 'splunk reload crl' in
the CLI. You must have 'edit_server_crl' capability to run this command.
By default 'edit_server_crl' is only assigned to the 'admin' role.

NOTE: Currently, the ability to use CRLs is only available in Common Criteria
      mode. It is disabled otherwise and has no effect on configurations not
      running in Common Criteria mode.
